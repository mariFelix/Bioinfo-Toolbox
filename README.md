===============
    M E N U 
  Data Mining 
===============

Please make a choice among the following :
    1 - Search datasets on database (ChIP-seq by protein)
    2 - Search datasets on database (ChIP-seq by cell type)
    3 - Search datasets on database (DNase-seq by cell type)
    4 - Download datasets from tsv file
    5 - Quit the program

Your choice : 
```

###### OPTION 1

```
 1 - Search datasets on database (ChIP-seq by protein)
----------------------------------------------------------
Please enter the maximum number of Id you want to retrieve in each of the 2 databases [1-100000] :
```

```
Please enter a protein name (or many coma-separated) you want to search datasets for :
```

```
Number of datasets found in GEO database : X
Number of datasets found in SRA database : Y
There is Z non overlapping datasets found for this query !
Do you want to save the information of this search in a tsv file ? [yes|no] : 
```

```
Please enter an output file name for the Z dataset(s) found :
```

```
Information extracted for GEO Id : XXXXXXXXX
...
Information extracted for SRA Id : XXXXXX
...
File test.tsv created !
```

###### OPTION 2

```
 2 - Search datasets on database (ChIP-seq by cell type)
----------------------------------------------------------

```

```
Number of datasets found in GEO database : X
Number of datasets found in SRA database : Y
There is Z non overlapping datasets found for this query !
Do you want to save the information of this search in a tsv file ? [yes|no] :
```

```
Please enter an output file name for the 20 dataset(s) found :
```

```
Information extracted for GEO Id : XXXXXXXXX
...
Information extracted for SRA Id : XXXXXXX
...
File test.tsv created !
```





###### OPTION 3

```
 3 - Search datasets on database (DNase-seq by cell type)
